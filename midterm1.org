* Why Computer Architecture

** Definitions

- /Computer/ is a machine that can be programmed to *carry out computation automatically*
- /Architecture/ is a *conceiving, planning, and designing structures*
  + CA has purpose only when given SW
- /Software/ is a *description of a computation* expressed in a programming language, any data, and documentation
  + Purpose 1: Definining an DS & A
  + Purpose 2: Executing
- /Interpreter/ *executes software*
  + Directly executes instructions expressed in a PL
  + *Does NOT rely on "Turtles all the way down"* (interpreter for interpreter for interpreter...) approach
- /Compiling/ is the process of *traslating* programs written in one *HLL* (High-level language) into a *LLL* that *has a machine interpreter*
  
** C Compiling Process

// TODO
#+begin_src
source_code -> preprocessor -> preprocessed source code -> compiler -> assembly code -> assembler -> relocatable object code -> linker (w/ object code in lib) -> binary object code
#+end_src

- Preprocessed Source Code: Does not contain *comments, macros, includes*, etc 
- Assembly Code: *Machine specific*

** Mechanical Computers

- Antikythera Mechanism (200B.C): Count Olumpics days
- Charles Babbage (1849)

*** Disadvantages

- Parts are small, require individual assembly
- Part shape and size determine computational function
- Parts cause waer and accuracy degrades over time
- Algorithm are slow

** Vacuum Tube Computers

- Colossus

*** Disadvantages

- About the same volume as mechanical computer
- Uses a lot of electrical energy
- Vacuum tubes burn out

** Transistor

- First one built at AT&T Bell Labs
- Used to use germanium crystal, now use silicon
- Futures are graphene or single layer of carbon

** Two Architectures

*** Harvard Architecture

*Separate memories* for instructions and data

*** Von Neumann Architecture

*Single memory* for instruction and data

* Representation

** Electrical Representation of Bits

- *V (max) voltage V - $\Delta$* is recognizes as 1
- *0 to 0 + $\delta$* is recognizes as 0
- *Rising edge* and *falling edge* are ignored

** Bit String

- *Bus: Collection of k wires carrying k-bits*
- *k-bits* on *k-wires*
- k-bits can represent up to *$2^k$ values*
- /Bit strings are only meaningful when it is paried with a representation/

* Regular Representations

** Unsigned integer, base 2, weighted positional

*Regular binary number* that we think of normally.

~001011~ = $0 \times 2^5 + 0 \times 2^4 + 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 11$

** Sign Magnitude

*UIB2WP but the MSB is the sign* (MSP = left most bit).

~101011~ = $-1(0 \times 2^4 + 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0) = -11$

*** Disadvantages of sign magnitude

- There are two zeros (0000 = +0, 1000 = -1)
- Less number can be represented (duh)

** Two's Complement
