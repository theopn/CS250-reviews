* Why Computer Architecture

** Definitions

- /Computer/ is a *machine that can be programmed to carry out computation automatically*
- /Architecture/ is a *conceiving, planning, and designing structures*
  + CA has purpose only when given SW
- /Software/ is a *description of a computation expressed in a programming language, any data, and documentation*
  + Purpose 1: Definining an DS & A
  + Purpose 2: Executing
- /Interpreter/ *executes software*
  + Directly executes instructions expressed in a PL
  + **Does NOT reply on "Turtles all the way down" (interpreter for interpreter for interpreter...) approach*
- /Compiling/ is the process of **traslating programs written in one HLL (High-level language) into a LLL that has a machine interpreter**
  
** C Compiling Process

#+begin_src
source_code -> preprocessor -> preprocessed source code -> compiler -> assembly code -> assembler -> relocatable object code -> linker (w/ object code in lib) -> binary object code
#+end_src

** Mechanical Computers

- Antikythera Mechanism (200B.C): Count Olumpics days
- Charles Babbage (1849)

*** Disadvantages

- Parts are small, require individual assembly
- Part shape and size determine computational function
- Parts cause waer and accuracy degrades over time
- Algorithm are slow

** Vacuum Tube Computers

- Colossus

*** Disadvantages

- About the same volume as mechanical computer
- Uses a lot of electrical energy
- Vacuum tubes burn out

** Transistor

- First one built at AT&T Bell Labs
- Used to use germanium crystal, now use silicon
- Futures are graphene or single layer of carbon

** Two Architectures

*** Harvard Architecture

**Separate memories** for instructions and data

*** Von Neumann Architecture

**Single memory** for instruction and data

* Representation
